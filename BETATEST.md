## Do you want to be a beta tester?

### Step 1:

Go to app.octoblu.com, go to "All Things", create a generic device with any name you want, and a type of "device:<connector-name>". The <connector-name> could be "bean" or any of the old connector names without the "meshblu-" prefix. So for the bean, use "device:bean" or the for the shell connector use "device:shell"

### Step 2:

Go to the recently created device.

### Step 3:

Click the spaceship next to the top right buttons. It should then show you new button. Click the button. It should say downloading, and it will download a pre-configured installer.

### Step 4:

Open up the installer DMG, open the MeshbluConnectorInstaller, and click the install button.

### Step 5:

Once the installer is done. Go back to app.octoblu.com and the device screen (you may need to reload). And you should see the device options, if there are any. And that is it! You're device should be running.
